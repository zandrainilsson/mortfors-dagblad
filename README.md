# ðŸ—ž MÃ¶rtfors Dagblad ðŸ—ž
The project was created as part of the course [Database Techonology](https://edu.mau.se/sv/course/da217a) at [MalmÃ¶ University](https://mau.se/) by [Zandra Nilsson](https://github.com/zandrainilsson). 

It is a newspaper web application written in [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) using [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) to display articles stored in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. Simple users can navigate through different categories of articles and provide comments to these, whereas admin-users have the ability to create new articles, oversee comments made by users, as well as display and add journalists of the newspaper.
